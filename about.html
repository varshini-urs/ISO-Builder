<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>Welcome to our project dedicated to building ISO images!</p>

<h2>What is an ISO Image?</h2>
<p>An ISO image is an archive file (also known as a disk image) of an optical disc, typically a CD or DVD. It contains all the files and folders that were on that disc in a single file. This format is commonly used for distributing software, operating systems, and other large sets of files.</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>Our project aims to provide a comprehensive guide and tools for creating custom ISO images tailored to specific needs. Whether you're developing software, distributing educational materials, or configuring a specialized operating system, understanding how to build your own ISO image can be incredibly valuable.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Customization: Learn how to customize your ISO image with specific files, configurations, and software packages.
<br>Automation: Explore methods for automating the ISO image creation process to streamline your workflow.<br>
Optimization: Discover techniques for optimizing your ISO image to reduce its size and improve performance.
<br>Compatibility: Ensure compatibility across different platforms and systems with our best practices and tips.</p>
<h2>Who Should Use This?</h2>
<p>This project is ideal for:

<br>Software developers
<br>System administrators
<br>Educators
<br>Hobbyists and enthusiasts interested in exploring the intricacies of ISO image creation.</p>
